hello! this is where the files for my final project, Persona Compendium are stored. 

there are 3 HTML pages: 
  final.html: the home page
  documentation.html: the about page with links to youtube video and this repository
  details.html: the page that displays more details about a persona clicked from the home page. this page works with local data, so just opening the page without anything stored won't show much.

  these pages are linking to the three css files respectivly, personas.css, documentation.css, and details.css 

  finally are the javascript files and the json file: 
  personas.js: attached to the home page, and handles the sorting of the json file through the reactions. 
  details.js: configures the html code for details.html based on the last persona clicked. 

  persona3.json: the json file which has all the information for my project. 
  Credits to Luyluish for creating the Json file. their github repository is here: https://github.com/luyluish/persona-compendium?tab=readme-ov-file


there are instructions on how to use the page in the youtube video and about page.
