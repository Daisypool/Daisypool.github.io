            <h2> Geocities </h2>
            <p> Geocities was a website invented to give people "free realestate" on the internet. It allowed people to easily create webstites of their own and connecst with people with simalare interests as them. Brandon Stanton creates geocities, giving each peorson a space on the internet with 15MB of space to use. Eventually Yahoo bought the website after it grew popular in a multi-billion dollar deal. In 2009, Yahoo shut down the site. Many sites were lost, including family photo albums, personal pages, and writing pages.</p>

            <p> The first email spam sent out was from Gary Thuerk, a DEC marketer to promote an open house. the email addresses spilled over into the mail, beacuse they tried to sent it to too many people. They expected people to get upset at the mail but the reaction was far greater than anticipated. </p>
