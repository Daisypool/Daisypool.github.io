    <h1> 24 Hours Without the Internet </h1>

    <div class="inline">
        <p> I had never tried to spend a whole day without my phone since I got one back in freshman year of high
            school. The internet and technology have become such an important part of our lives that we can’t even get
            stuff done without it. To prepare for the day without it, I told my sister that I would be away from my
            phone for the day. I mainly did that because I talk to her often and I would feel guilty if she worried
            about if I was ok when I didn’t answer her texts. I decided to not go out anywhere, because I realized I
            heavily relied on my phone’s GPS to get me anywhere, without it I would have been more likely to get on the
            wrong bus or get lost. Instead, I spent most of the day re-reading one of my favorite books, Howls Moving
            Castle. It was nice, because I kept meaning to read it again, but I never made time for it. However, there
            were a lot of times during the day that I wanted to check my phone, in case someone had texted me, or just
            to check random apps that honestly just waste my time. The one thing I missed the most though was playing
            music from my phone. It’s the thing I do most with my phone. Anytime I’m not actively in a class or in a
            social setting, I listen to music from my phone. I have been like that since I got my phone, even before
            then when I had an old MP3 player. While having access to everything from the internet can be a lot, and
            probably not very good for us, having access to almost any music, and having an easy way to find new things
            I might like is one of my favorite parts of the internet. Overall though, the whole day was very relaxing,
            and I felt less stressed when I wasn’t constantly checking my phone or going on social media. </p>
